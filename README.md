# FrontEnd Challenge for Youtan

This projet was developed using **React** and **Tailwind**.

The goal of this challenge was to recreate with as much fidelity as possible a design given by the team.
The final result isn't perfect but works and has room for improvment.
This was my first time using **Tailwind** so the code is no as clean as it could be.

Notable errors:

-   **The font.** I decide to focus my energy in putting everything together so I didn't find the original font of the design.

-   **Horizontal Overlow.** This was a major problem present in the project. I couldn't find a good easy solution to it. I think the cause of this issue is my lak of experience using Tailwind. Put a couple more time into the project and it should be solved.

-   **Missing design of the other pages.** Well, the design that I received had only the design for the Pets page, so that's what I coded.
